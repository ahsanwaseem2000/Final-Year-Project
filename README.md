 Project Title: Single phase compact DC-AC power converter for medium and high power applications
 
 This project aims to design and develop an innovative single-phase DC-AC power converter tailored for medium
 and high-power applications.
 The primary objective is to achieve a higher number of output voltage levels while using a reduced number
 of components, resulting in enhanced power conversion efficiency, reduced harmonics, and improved system
 performance.
